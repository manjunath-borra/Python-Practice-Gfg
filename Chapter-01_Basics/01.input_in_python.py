# In Python Programming Language User Input is given using "input()"
# "input()" returns string type only. To Convert the return Type we should use Typecasting 
name = input("Enter your name :- ")
print("Hello",name,"! Welcome")
print(type(name))

#  In the above programif we give the input as "SAM" or "1234" the type of varable "name" will be "String"
# ln5 will be used to check the type of variable "name"
