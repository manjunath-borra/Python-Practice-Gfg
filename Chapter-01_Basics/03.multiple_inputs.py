# In Python Programming language Multiple inputs can be taken at once.
m,f =input("Enter 2 Values :- ").split()
print("Number of Males : ",m)
print("Number of females : ",f)

# In the above program "split()" is used to split the values among both 'm' and 'f'
# The split() method always returns input values as strings. 
# If you need them as numbers (int or float), you must convert them using typecasting.
